By combining the emitted light from the different phosphorous range of color can \\\\nbe generate. Two basic technique for producing color display with CRT are: \\\\n1. Beam penetration method. \\\\n2. Shadow-mask Method.  \\\\n1. Beam penetration method:  \\\\n- This method is commonly used for random scan system.  \\\\n- In beam penetration method, two layers of phosphor usually red and green are coated on \\\\nthe CRT screen, and displayed color depends on how far the electron beam penetrates \\\\ninto phosphor layer. \\\\n- Slow electron beam excites only the outer red layer. \\\\n- Very fast electron beam penetrates through red and excites the inner green layer. \\\\n- Intermediate beam speeds produce combination of red and green light. \\\\nLimitations: \\\\n- Quality of picture is not good as with other methods. \\\\n- It is an inexpensive way to produce color in random scan monitors, but only four colors \\\\nare possible. \\\\n \\\\n2. Shadow mask method: \\\\n- This method is commonly used in raster scan systems because they can produce wide \\\\nrange of colors than beam penetration. \\\\n- A shadow mask CRT has three phosphor color dots at each pixel position. One emits red \\\\nlight, another emits green light and third emits blue light. \\\\n- The CRT has three electron guns, one for each color dot and shadow-mask grid is placed \\\\njust behind the phosphor coated screen. \\\\n- Two types of arrangements are there for shadow-mask method: \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Delta-delta arrangement \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 In-line arrangement \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nD.
